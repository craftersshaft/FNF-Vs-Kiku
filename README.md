# Features

 - **New Input System**
	 - An improved input system, similar to Quaver or Etterna, with less delays, less dropped inputs and other improvements.
 - **More information during gameplay**
	 - While you're playing, we show you information about how you're doing, such as your accuracy, combo break count, notes per second, and your grade/rating.
 - **Better key layouts**
	 - Instead of being forced to use WASD and the arrow keys, now you can play with DFJK!
 - **Replays** (in beta)
	 - Have you ever gotten a crazy score but didn't record? The replay system solves that: it automatically saves a "replay" of your gameplay every time you complete a song, which you can play back inside of the game. 
	 - Replays just store information about what you're doing, they don't actually record the screen -- so they take up way less space on your disk than videos.
 - **Audio offset**
	 - If your headphones are delayed, you can set an offset in the options menu to line the game up with the delay and play with synced audio like intended.
